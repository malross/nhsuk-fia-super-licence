        How to earn points
      </h2>

      <p>
        Points can be earned in the following ways:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
          By completing at least 80% of races in an eligible championship
        </li>
        <li>
          By driving in Formula 1 free practice sessions
        </li>
        <li>
          By completing a full season without receiving any penalty points in a championship that uses the
          FIA penalty point system. Two points are awarded for each year that includes a penalty-free
          championship.
        </li>
      </ul>
